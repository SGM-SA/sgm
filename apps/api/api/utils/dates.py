# Merci Ã  chatGPT pour le code et les regles concernant les dates (IsO 8601) :
# To correctly use the ISO 8601 standard in Python, you should use %G, %V, and %u, where:
#
# %G: The ISO 8601 week-numbering year, which is slightly different than the regular calendar year.
# %V: The ISO 8601 week number.
# %u: The ISO 8601 weekday, where Monday is 1 and Sunday is 7.
